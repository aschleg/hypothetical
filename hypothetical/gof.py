class ChiSquareTest(object):
    r"""
    Performs the one-sample Chi-Square goodness-of-fit test.

    Parameters
    ----------
    observed : array-like
        One-dimensional array of observed frequencies.
    expected : array-like, optional
        One-dimensional array of expected frequencies. If not given, the expected frequencies are computed
        as the mean of the observed frequencies (each category is equally likely to occur).
    continuity : bool, optional
        Applies Yates's continuity correction for approximation error. Defaults to False as the correction can
        tend to overcorrect and result in a type II error.
    degrees_freedom : int, optional
        Degrees of freedom. The p-value in the chi-square test is computed with degrees of freedom is :math:`k - 1`,
        where :math:`k` is the number of observed frequencies.

    Attributes
    ----------
    observed : array-like
        One-dimensional array of observed frequencies.
    expected : array-like
        One-dimensional array of expected frequencies.
    degrees_of_freedom : int
        Total degrees of freedom used in the computation of the p-value.
    continuity_correction : bool
        If True, Yates's continuity correction is applied when performing the chi-square test
    n : int
        Total number of observed frequencies.
    chi_square : float
        The computed test statistic, the chi-square, :math:`\chi^2` value.
    p_value : float
        The calculated p-value of the test given the chi-square statistic and degrees of freedom.
    test_summary : dict
        Dictionary containing a collection of the resulting test statistics and other information.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the :code:`expected` parameter is passed but is not of the same length as the required :code:`observed`
        parameter, a :code:`ValueError` is raised.

    Notes
    -----
    The chi-squared test, often called the :math:`\chi^2` test, is also known as Pearson's chi-squared test. The
    chi-square test is a one-sample goodness-of-fit test that evaluates whether a significant difference exists between
    an observed number of frequencies from two or more groups and an expected frequency based on a null hypothesis. A
    simple example of a chi-square test is testing whether a six-sided die is 'fair', in that all outcomes are equally
    likely to occur.

    The chi-square test statistic, :math:`\chi^2` is defined as:

    .. math::

        \chi^2 = \sum^k_{i=1} \frac{O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}

    Where :math:`O_i` is the observed number of frequencies in the :math:`i`th category, :math:`E_i` is the expected
    number of frequencies in the respective :math:`i`th group, and :math:`k` is the total number of groups or
    categories, or 'cells'.

    The p-value can then be found by comparing the calculated :math:`\chi^2` statistic to a chi-square distribution.
    The degrees of freedom is equal to :math:`k - 1` minus any additional reduction in the degrees of freedom, if
    specified.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> observed = [29, 19, 18, 25, 17, 10, 15, 11]
    >>> expected = [18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18]
    >>> ch = ChiSquareTest(observed, expected)
    >>> ch.test_summary
    {'chi-square': 16.333333333333332,
     'continuity correction': False,
     'degrees of freedom': 7,
     'p-value': 0.022239477462390588}
    >>> ch = ChiSquareTest(observed)
    >>> ch.test_summary
    {'chi-square': 16.333333333333332,
     'continuity correction': False,
     'degrees of freedom': 7,

    Notes
    -----
    The Jarque-Bera test is a goodness-of-fit test developed by Carlos Jarque and Anil Bera that tests whether
    a sample of data is normally distributed using the sample's kurtosis and skewness. The Jarque-Bera test
    statistic is defined as:

    .. math::

        JB = \frac{n}{6} \large( s^2 + \frac{(k-3)^2}{4} \large)

    where :math:`n` is the number of samples in the data, :math:`s` is the computed sample's skewness and :math:`k` is
    the sample's kurtosis. The Jarque-Bera test statistic has a chi-square distribution with two degrees of freedom
    when the number of samples is adequate. The test statistic is always non-negative and the farther away from zero,
    the stronger of an indication the sample data does not follow a normal distribution.

    In the case of small samples ('small' being somewhat subjective but generally considered to be :math:`n < 30`),
    the Jarque-Bera test and statistic is overly-sensitive and can lead to large Type 1 error rates.
